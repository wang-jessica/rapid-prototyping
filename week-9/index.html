## Week 9 - Energy Storage Team Progress
This week, we shared updates as a large group and indentified some changes to make to our individual designs. According to the collection team's design, heat transfer from the solar collector to the storage salt box will be on one of the box's vertical sides. This change ended up simplifying our design by negating the need for a hole in the box's bottom insulation and allowing us to leave one vertical side completely free of the firebrick and wood framework. 
<br>
<br>
With this update in mind, half of storage team revised the brick/framework configuration while the other half tested and recorded data on the heat transfer surface insulation mechanism with a hotplate.
<br>
<br>
Pictured below is a rough sketch of the initial brick design (assuming heat transfer on bottom rather than side), followed by the revised physical structure:
