## Week 11 - Energy Storage/Collection Team Progress
This week, we continued constructing the second iteration of the parabolic reflector by assembling a ring-shaped frame and attaching a Mylar sheet. The ring shape consisted of eight quarter-annulus pieces of wood that fit together to form an upper and lower ring, serving as a clamp for the Mylar sheet. We hot glued the bottom ring to a thin wooden base, then sealed the combined components with polyurethane spray. Pictured is the wooden base and ring before sealing.

We then used laminating epoxy to attach the mylar sheet to this bottom ring via the silver side, so that when pumped with air, this side will be the concave dish reflecting sunlight. We used various objects as weights to hold the Mylar down while the epoxy dried, shown below.

Another aspect that the group worked on as a whole was constructions to prepare for fitting the solar reflector, collector/insulated salt box, and rolling base together. Depicted below is the measurement for holes that we'll eventually string a rod through to support the parabolic dish above the insulated salt box.
