## Week 4 - Energy Storage Team Progress

This week, we worked in the specific groups of energy collection, energy storage, and cooking to develop some details about our project. On the storage team, we used the following questions to guide our development:
<br>
- what form of heat storage (chemical, sensible, latent) is the most efficient for this project?
<br>
- what heat storage material should be used, considering safety, heat capacity, heat of fusion, corrisivity, and affordability?
<br>
- how can we control the level of heat being applied to the cooking surface?
  
<br>
<br>

After seeing the other groups' pin ups and discussing how all of our work connects, we concluded that our goal is to provide 400F-450F to the cooking surfacce, with a 100F minimum. We also considered making a partitioned stovetop where each section has a different temperature. This would circumvent the problem of long wait-times when a dish has multiple stages of cooking with different temperatures.
<br>
We decided that latent heat storage is the most effective method; sensible heat storage would have a varying operating temperature, which can be less predictable and cause waste, and chemical heat storage's high maximum temperature makes execution harder and potentially more dangerous. One large contender for storage material is nitrate eutectic, which is likely available in the MIT MakerSpace and is already commonly used for thermal storage.
