## Week 8 - Energy Storage Team Progress
This week, we changed our overall approach for the project to focus more on the fundamental structures of a solar collector, salt battery, and heat transfer surface to cook an item, rather than creating an entirely thought-out device meant for users external to the class. This change was motivated by our preference towards creating some physical, working prototypes and moving beyond the brainstorm and CAD phase of design. Ideally, the physical prototypes we create would give future classes a better understanding of how the salt battery works in reality.
<br>
In light of the new changes, storage team divided into two groups based on two different tasks: flattening the surface of the aluminum bar to test the sliding-surface design instead of fins, and creating an insulator/holder for the salt battery. 
<br>
On the insulating subteam, we gathered firebricks and plywood that were no longer in use from MITâ€™s architecture shop to start drafting a design for the insulator. Some considerations for the design include: 
<br>
How much thermal expansion will affect the design, and what margin of error is acceptable?
<br>
If the firebricks are of insufficient volume/shape, can we fill in the empty spaces with other insulators like sand?
<br>
How should the base insulator and frame accommodate for the heat transfer patch from the solar collector?
<br>
How should the side insulators accommodate for the heat transfer mechanism of the cooking surface?
<br>
Pictured below is a possible configuration for the firebrick insulator:
