## Week 5 - Energy Storage Team Progress
This week, we received access to a salt box to use when modeling our project. Here are some details:
<br>
- made in MIT Central Machine Shop, intended to store heat for 24hrs in a Mongolian heating system
<br>
- dimensions: 6x7x11 inch exterior, with 0.5 inch thickness
<br>
- stainless steel, has been heated before
<br>
- contains unknown quantity of sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate
<br>

Given this new parameter, our next step within the storage team is to modify our idea for heat transfer between the PCM and the cooking surface to account for the surface area of the box. Below are three possible heat control mechanisms, each with a different spatial configuration.
1. slider (previous idea): heat transfer area is half the box surface area, with the other half reserved for horizontal sliding mechanism
2. vertical fins: heat transfer area is the entire box surface area, with larger height requirement for vertical sliding mechanism
3. horizontal fins: heat transfer area depends on how large the overhang is between the conducting fins and the box
<br>
