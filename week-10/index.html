## Week 10 - Energy Storage Team Progress
This week, we finished assembling the frame for the salt box and firebrick insulators by first completing 3 pilot holes in each of the side planks and 9 holes in the base, and then drilling actual screws to hold the planks together.
<br>
<br>
One problem we encountered at first was a misalignment between the pilot holes for the base and side pieces, which we suspect was due to a measurement error when transferring hole markings between them. To fix this, we ended up hand drilling a new pilot hole through the base and sides at the same time to make sure they lined up.
<br>
<br>
We then placed the firebricks and salt box inside to make sure there werenâ€™t any major misfits (pictured below).

The group also began the second iteration of a parabolic reflector for the solar collector component of our device. The process of making the reflector is to inflate a mylar space blanket with a bicycle air pump so it forms a parabolic mirror shape. Once this happens, a fiberglass mesh covers the parabola to reinforce it.
<br>
<br>
One aspect of this process that needs troubleshooting and will likely be addressed next week is to prevent wrinkles from forming at the base of the air bubble, because this could hinder a clear reflection path and create noise instead of concentrating the light during solar collection.
