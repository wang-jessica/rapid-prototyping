## Week 6 - Energy Storage Team Progress
This week, everyone within the storage team and other teams integrated into one shared Fusion360 workspace to ease collaboration and share our CAD designs. We also individually completed Fusion360 tutorials to develop more skills, with a focus on practice components that may relate well to the solar cooking device. Below is my work following a tutorial for a general sliding shaft, which can potentially be fitted with a moving component.

Within the storage team, we also began work on prototyping the energy storage unit with steel bars ordered from McMaster-Carr and brought to the Beaver Works Lab. Components of this work include:	
<br>
<br>
- using a metal file to smooth out gravelly parts of the steel bars and prevent bumps in later processes
<br>
- using an endmill to level out the surfaces of the base steel bar
<br>
- using a bandsaw to cut the thin steel bars into smaller segments
<br>
- using a drill to drill holes into the steel bar segments
<br>
<br>
The goal for next week is to become more acquainted with the machines in the lab and possibly start assmebling all of the smaller bars into a main prototype whose heat transferability can be tested with a hot plate.
