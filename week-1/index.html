## Week 1 - Precedents


The focus of Rapid Prototyping's Fall 2021 project is energy capture in the context of sustainability. Our objective for the project is to demonstrate an energy sustainability concept to the public, replace a traditional form of energy in doing some task, and/or to capture energy in a new and useful way to humanity.
One example to gather inspiration from is Theo Jansen's "Strandbeest," an art-centered educational project featuring wind-powered plastic tube structures (pictured below).

Precedent Research:

Spherical Sun Power Generator "beta.ray" by German architect Andre Broessel  
* meant to capture solar energy more effectively and with less surface area than regular solar panels  
* sphere concentrates light onto a very small solar panel surface at the bottom, reducing the size that the panel must be  
* project can be implemented into electric car charging, public lighting at night, and possibly solar hybrid power plants if developed further
