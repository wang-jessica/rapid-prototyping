## Week 7 - Energy Storage Team Progress
This week, we accomplished more work on our storage device prototype in the Beaver Works Lab. In continuation of last week's focus, we refined our process for measuring and drilling holes into the thin bar segments that will become the sliding components of our system. Initially, we used a digital caliper to measure hole location, marked the location with an automatic spring-loaded punch, then drilled the holes while keeping the bar clamped in a vice. Due to the hole markings being too small, we struggled to gauge whether the drill actually aligned with our measurements, and we had a lot of asymmetry within our first bar. To fix this, we reinforced each punch marking with a marking from a larger punch, which was large enough for the drill head to be guided by it.

Another focus we took on this week was drilling one slider ridge into our base bar and evaluating how tightly the small bars fit inside. Ideally, we hoped that a bar could match the slider perfectly with no misfit, because this would maximize conductivity between them and minimize energy waste. While our fit wasn't perfect, we figured that the level of imprecision wouldn't substantially harm our prototype.

In preparation for next week, when a team of experts will be advising us on our project, we're drafting some sketches and models to convey the main aspects of our solar cooker and get some feedback on how to move forward with them.
