## Week 7 - Energy Storage Team Progress and Mid-Review
In the past two weeks, we accomplished more work on our storage device prototype in the Beaver Works Lab. In continuation of last week's focus, we refined our process for measuring and drilling holes into the thin bar segments that will become the sliding components of our system. Initially, we used a digital caliper to measure hole location, marked the location with an automatic spring-loaded punch, then drilled the holes while keeping the bar clamped in a vice. Due to the hole markings being too small, we struggled to gauge whether the drill actually aligned with our measurements, and we had a lot of asymmetry within our first bar. To fix this, we reinforced each punch marking with a marking from a larger punch, which was large enough for the drill head to be guided by it. Eventually, we struggled to fit a rod through these revised holes as well, so we improvised for a hand drill to create a clear path through the bars.

Another focus we took on was drilling slider ridges into our base bar and evaluating how tightly the small bars fit inside. Ideally, we hoped that a bar could match the slider perfectly with no misfit, because this would maximize conductivity between them and minimize energy waste. While our fit wasn't perfect, we figured that the level of imprecision wouldn't harm our ability to communicate the main idea of the mechanism.

In preparation for our mid-review, when a team of experts advised us on our project, we drafted some sketches and models to convey the main aspects of our solar cooker and get some feedback on how to move forward with them. Below is the link to storage team's presentation, as well as some sketches for potential heat transfer mechanisms.
