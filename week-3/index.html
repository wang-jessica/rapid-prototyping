## Week 3 - Convergence on Group Project
	
Our tentative project for this term is to design a renewable energy powered cooking device for student use on Kresge lawn. The group motivation to design something utilitarian rather than for display was to demonstrate that renewable energy has a real place in people's lives. The concept of heating objects is also general enough that our results might be cross-applied to other projects beyond cooking. Ideally, the device will be able to heat food, which prerequires that it also is able to heat water for warm-drink dispensing (or just having hot water).	 
<br>
Research questions:
<br>
- Does our idea for sustainably-powered cooking already exist? And if so, can we improve on the design?
<br>
- What types of cooking and associated temperature ranges will this device focus on? Will the device transfer heat through conduction, convection, or radiation?
<br>
- What is the best medium for storing heat (eg water, antifreeze material, solids)? Do we want to use phase change?
<br>
<br>
Energy storage team notes:
<br>
- The storage component of our device should have a high heat capacity and account for safety (toxicity, flammability, etc)
<br>
- Consider which parts need high/low conductivity, either achieved by material property or by our configurations
